                <h1>Basketball</h1>
            </div>
            
            <p> Basketball is a team sport in which two teams,five players of each team opposing one another on a rectangular floor court, try to score the most points before the game ends.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Timing of one game:</h2>
            <p>An NBA game is 4 quarters of 12 minutes each, for a total of 48 minutes. 
                However, regulation time is stopped for many aspects of game play, like fouls, ball out-of-bounds, timeouts, and a 15-minute halftime. 
                That makes the wall-clock duration of typical games 2-2.5 hours.</p>
        </section>
        
        
        <section>
            
            <h2>Positions:</h2>       
                <p> <img class="sports" src="images\Basketball/Basketballpositions.png" 
                    alt="basketball"/>
                    <h3>Centre:</h3> <p>The centre is usually the team’s tallest and strongest player and is positioned under the basket. 
                    He is also required to be physically domineering with more physical strength and athleticism.
                    On the offensive play, most centres do not consistently score midrange or beyond the arch. Instead,
                    most of their points should be from offensive rebounds and are also required to block defenders to open other players up for driving to the basket.
                    On the defence, the centre is responsible for keeping the opponent from shooting by blocking shots and passes in the vital area. 
                    They’re also expected to fight for rebounds as they’re usually taller physically.</p>
               
                <h3>Power Forward:</h3> <p>Power Forwards are usually the second tallest in the team and are the closest to the centre in terms of physical attributes and playing style but with more speed.
                    They are often the most versatile player, being able to score in the paint as well as being able to shoot from midrange. 
                    It will be more effective if they’re able to land a three-point consistently.
                    Defensively, they are required to have the strength to guard bigger players close to the basket. </p>
                
                <h3>Small forward:</h3> <p>The Small Forward is usually the shorter of the two forwards on the team but plays the most versatile role out of the main five positions.
                    He must have enough height and the ability to play on the inside as well as agility to play on the outside, similar to a shooting guard. 
                    Small Forwards are usually the second or third best shooters on the team and should be able to do a little bit of everything on the court.</p>
                
                <h3>Shooting Guard:</h3> <p>Potentially the shortest player on the team, the Shooting Guard is the team’s best outside shooter. 
                    Besides being able to shoot well, the Shooting Guard needs to be good at dribbling fast, passing and having court vision by seeing the court.
                    He is also responsible for driving the ball down the court and setting up offensive plays.
                    A good Shooting Guard will be a threat to his opponent as he’s able to score from anywhere on the court.</p>
               
                <h3>Point Guard:</h3> <p>The Point Guard is usually the shortest but the best ball handler on the team. 
                    Also known as the ‘coach on the floor’ or the ‘floor general’, a point guard is responsible for directing plays.
                    He needs to have good court vision to create open shots for the receivers as well as drive the ball down the court and initiate offensive plays.
                    Point Guards need to have an excellent long-distance shooting, though it’s not quite as crucial as for shooting guards,
                    some point guards take as many shots as shooting guards.</p>

            <h3>Basketball</h3>
            <p> Basketball is a sport where two teams compete to score the most 
                points (baskets) before the game ends.</p>
        </section>

            <h4>Basketball allows players to:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Work on their hand-eye coordination</li>
                <li>Work on their reflexes</li>

        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>More Details</h3>
            <p> A basketball team is comprised of five players and consequently
                five different positions.</p>
            <h4>The positions include:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Point Guard</li>
                    <ul><li>The point guard is typically the team's best 
                        ball handler and passer. For this reason, they are 
                        usually the ones that call the plays and direct their 
                        teammates.</li></ul>
                <li>Shooting Guard</li>
                    <ul><li>As the name suggests, they are known for their 
                        shooting. Shooting guards are usually the players 
                        that are the most skilled at taking three point shots.
                    </li></ul>
                <li>Small Forward</li>
                    <ul><li>Small forwards are generally the most versatile 
                        of all the players on the court. The reason they need 
                        to be versatile is because they are usually asked to 
                        fill in different roles.</li></ul>
                <li>Power Forward</li>
                    <ul><li>The power forward more closely resembles the 
                        post/center player because they are usually taller in 
                        stature than are small forwards. For this reason, they 
                        serve as backups to the fifth position.</li></ul>
                <li>Post/Center</li>
                    <ul><li>The fifth and final positions: post/center. 
                        These players are more often than not the tallest 
                        players are the court. They play a key role on 
                        defense as well as on offense, due to their big size.
                        Because of their size, they are usually referred to as 
                        "bigs".</li></ul>
            </ul>
            <p> Each game will last 48 minutes, divided into 4 quarters, 
                each lasting 12 minutes. There will be a 2-minute break in 
                between each quarter.</p>
            <img class="sports" id="basketball-positions" 
            src="images/Basketball/basketball-positions.png" 
            alt="Basketball Positions"/>
                <hr>
            <p> Each player will have the opportunity to choose the position 
                they would like to play. If the player does not have a desired 
                position, the manager will assign them a position.</p>
