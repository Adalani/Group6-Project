            <h3>Basketball</h3>
            <p> Basketball is a sport where two teams compete to score the most 
                points (baskets) before the game ends.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4>Basketball allows players to:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Work on their hand-eye coordination</li>
                <li>Work on their reflexes</li>
                <li>Learn how to keep a cool head</li>

            <h3>More Details</h3>
            <p> A basketball team is comprised of five players and consequently
                five different positions.</p>
            <h4>The positions include:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Point Guard</li>
                    <ul><li>The point guard is typically the team's best 
                        ball handler and passer. For this reason, they are 
                        usually the ones that call the plays and direct their 
                        teammates.</li></ul>
                <li>Shooting Guard</li>
                    <ul><li>As the name suggests, they are known for their 
                        shooting. Shooting guards are usually the players 
                        that are the most skilled at taking three point shots.
                    </li></ul>
                <li>Small Forward</li>
                    <ul><li>Small forwards are generally the most versatile 
                        of all the players on the court. The reason they need 
                        to be versatile is because they are usually asked to 
                        fill in different roles.</li></ul>
                <li>Power Forward</li>
                    <ul><li>The power forward more closely resembles the 
                        post/center player because they are usually taller in 
                        stature than are small forwards. For this reason, they 
                        serve as backups to the fifth position.</li></ul>
                <li>Post/Center</li>
                    <ul><li>The fifth and final positions: post/center. 
                        These players are more often than not the tallest 
                        players are the court. They play a key role on 
                        defense as well as on offense, due to their big size.
                        Because of their size, they are usually referred to as 
                        "bigs".</li></ul>
            </ul>
            <p> Each game will last 48 minutes, divided into 4 quarters, 
                each lasting 12 minutes. There will be a 2-minute break in 
                between each quarter.</p>

            alt="Basketball Positions"/>
                <hr>
            <p> Each player will have the opportunity to choose the position 
                they would like to play. If the player does not have a desired 
                position, the manager will assign them a position.</p>
