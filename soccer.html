                Soccer, otherwise known as Futbol (football) is a sport where
                players work as a team, kicking a ball around, to try to score
                a goal on the opponent's goalie. <br>
                While playing soccer, players will be able to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn teamwork</li>
                    <li>Work on communication</li>
                    <li>Identify their strengths</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>More Details</h3>
            <p>
                A soccer team is comprised of 11 players, one of them being the
                goalkeeper. <br>
                The positions include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Goalkeeper</li>
                    <li>Defense</li>
                    <li>Midfielder</li>
                    <li>Forward</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Each player will have the choice of the position they would 
                like to play. If the player does not have a desired position, 
                the manager will assign them a position.
