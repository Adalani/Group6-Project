    <h1> Hockey </h1>
    

    <p>
        
            Field hockey, known in most countries as just hockey, is a team game of the hockey family.The game is played between two teams of whom eleven, 10 field players and one goal keeper, are permitted to be on the pitch at any one time. The remaining players may be substituted in any combination. There is an unlimited number of times a team can sub in and out. Substitutions are permitted at any point in the game, apart from between the award and end of a penalty corner; two exceptions to this rule is for injury or suspension of the defending goalkeeper, which is not allowed when playing with a field keep, or a player can exit the field, but you must wait until after the inserter touches the ball to put somebody back in.

            Players are permitted to play the ball with the flat of the 'face side' and with the edges of the head and handle of the field hockey stick with the exception that, for reasons of safety, the ball may not be struck 'hard' with a forehand edge stroke, because of the difficulty of controlling the height and direction of the ball from that stroke.
            
            The flat side is always on the "natural" side for a right-handed person swinging the stick at the ball from right to left. Left-handed sticks are rare, but available; however they are pointless as the rules forbid their use in a game. To make a strike at the ball with a left-to-right swing the player must present the flat of the 'face' of the stick to the ball by 'reversing' the stick head, i.e. by turning the handle through approximately 180° (while a reverse edge hit would turn the stick head through approximately 90° from the position of an upright forehand stroke with the 'face' of the stick head).
            
            Edge hitting of the ball underwent a two-year "experimental period", twice the usual length of an "experimental trial" and is still a matter of some controversy within the game. Ric Charlesworth, the former Australian coach, has been a strong critic of the unrestricted use of the reverse edge hit. The 'hard' forehand edge hit was banned after similar concerns were expressed about the ability of players to direct the ball accurately, but the reverse edge hit does appear to be more predictable and controllable than its counterpart. This type of hit is now more commonly referred to as the "forehand sweep" where the ball is hit with the flat side or "natural" side of the stick and not the rounded edge.
            
            Other rules include; no foot-to-ball contact, no use of hands, no obstructing other players, no high back swing, and no third party. If a player is dribbling the ball and either loses control and kicks the ball or another player interferes that player is not permitted to gain control and continue dribbling. The rules do not allow the person who kicked the ball to gain advantage from the kick, so the ball will automatically be passed on to the opposing team. Conversely, if no advantage is gained from kicking the ball, play should continue. Players may not obstruct another's chance of hitting the ball in any way. No shoving/using your body/stick to prevent advancement in the other team. Penalty for this is the opposing team receives the ball and if the problem continues, the player can be carded. While a player is taking a free hit or starting a corner the back swing of their hit cannot be too high for this is considered dangerous. Finally there may not be three players touching the ball at one time. Two players from opposing teams can battle for the ball, however if another player interferes it is considered third party and the ball automatically goes to the team who only had one player involved in the third party.

        <h4>Position of hockey field </h4>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><strong>The midfield </strong> in field hockey are the inside-left and inside-right (inners) positions, and the centre half. They will roam the field and are used to link the defense with the offense, and are often required and expected to do a lot of running to make this happen!</li>
<br>
<br>
         <li><strong>The defensive </strong>line up consists of the left and right halfbacks, two fullbacks and goalkeeper. Unlike their striker counterparts, the half line will usually stay in their allotted positions, and might only move from right to left to cover injury or substitution. The left and right halfbacks will focus on defending against the wingers and wide strikers, although the half-line is also used in attacking situations, but are vulnerable to counter-attacks if they do run upfield.</li>
<br>
<br>
        <li><strong>The fullbacks </strong>will invariably stay in the defensive half of the field, although they can venture into the midfield or forward positions if there is room and opportunity to do so. There are traditionally a high and low fullback in field hockey – one who will mark the opposition centre-forward or striker, and the other will mark any roving or break-away players.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
         <li><strong>The goalkeeper </strong>will usually stay within the goal-circle, which is the only place they are allowed to use their body to play the ball. If a keeper leaves the circle, they are only able to play the ball with their stick. The goalkeeper’s main focus is to stop the ball from crossing the goal line.</li>    </div>

        <h4> Practice for Hockey</h4>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Get warmed up by having your teammates take soft hits, pushes and flicks at you. Get used to the ball coming onto you and feel comfortable within the goal box itself. Keep an indicator of where your posts are at all times.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
       <li> As a player approaches for a shot, imagine an imaginary line from each of the goal posts to the ball. The goalkeeper should stand on the inside of this angle to give themselves the best chance to stop the ball.</li>
       <br>
       <br>
       <li> Instruct the players to pass the ball laterally across the goal circle. Work on moving quickly to be inside of the angle as the ball crosses the field.</li>
       <br>
       <br>
       <li> Organize your team across the top of the goal circle, with a ball each. Alternate sides of the field to shoot from, ensuring that your positioning is good as the shots come from all angles. Concentrate on keeping your feet together and clearing the ball with hard kicks and sweeps with your hockey stick.</li>
