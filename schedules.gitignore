                that schedule is the one shown?

    Put all of the schedules on this page.
    Only have them appear when a condition is met
    i.e.: when something is clicked, a specific schedule
    will be displayed
    (or it could just be that this page links to other pages
    with the corresponding schedules.)

    If we decided to link to other pages, make the schedules
    open in a different page (with the _blank command)
