        <!--
            On every single page we make, we have to include at least one of every element we discussed
            in the classroom.  This includes images, videos, labels, forms... all of it.  However, I'm
            pretty sure that there are some exceptions as to what doesn't need to be included in every
            single page; we'd have to ask Brayden about it.
